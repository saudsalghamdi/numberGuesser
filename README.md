# numberGuesser

This is a practice project from the back-end Engineer career path at Codecadmey. 

index.html, style.css and game.js were pre-provided by Codecadmey. I wrote the script.js file.

# How to play

A randomised number will be generated whereby the user will compete against the computer to attempt to guess the randomised number. Once the user clicks the (Make a guess) button, the random generated number will be revealed, and the winner will be declared. If no correct guesses were made, then closest guess wins the game. If the user and the computer both make the same guess then the user will be declared the winner.
